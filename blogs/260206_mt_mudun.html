                <p class="mb-4">On a wonderfully warm day, our lab had the pleasure of a joint retreat with Dr. Song's Lab from Chosun University. We embarked on a trip to the beautiful Mudeungsan Mountain in Gwangju, South Korea.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">The day was filled with engaging research discussions, allowing us to share insights and explore new ideas in a relaxed environment. Beyond the academic exchange, we also enjoyed a fantastic lab retreat together, strengthening our camaraderie and creating memorable experiences.</p>
                <p>It was a truly valuable experience, fostering collaboration and team spirit between both labs.</p>

        <p>Prof. Michael J. Sadowsky was invited to give a plenary lecture at the MSK 2024 meeting held in Jeju on October 30. Not only did I do my postdoc in his lab, but he was also my co-supervisor for my Ph.D. thesis.</p>

        <p>Mike and I have published more than ten papers together over the years, and he has been very helpful in developing my career. He has many students in Korea; in fact, his first Ph.D. student was my thesis advisor, Prof. Hur, which makes Mike my academic “grandfather”—although he is the same age as my biological father.</p>

        <p>I hope to see him again before too long. Thanks for coming to Korea, Mike!</p>

        <p>CBNU has signed an MOU with Duy Tan University in Da Nang, Vietnam. I was selected for the collaboration project, and my partner, Dr. Cuong Xuan Nguyen, is a data analyst who uses AI to predict environmental pollution, particularly in relation to wastewater treatment plants.</p>

        <p>For this project, we agreed to focus on pollution in the Han River (Vietnam), specifically related to microplastics and heavy metals. Our lab will conduct microbial source tracking to determine the origins of microplastics, while the Duy Tan team will develop a model to assess pollution levels caused by microplastics and heavy metals based on physicochemical parameters.</p>

        <p>Dr. Nguyen Huy Thuan also agreed to help us for extracting DNA from river samples. Hoping for successful outcomes!</p>
